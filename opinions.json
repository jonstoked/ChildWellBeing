However, I have found that very small stories and rigid rules are paramount to a successful mob programming exercise. In addition, mob programming in my experience has been a disaster for learning new technologies. I have found it much easier for each team member to learn on their own and have turn around sessions to transfer knowledge.",

Although others can edit it, you cannot transfer ownership or copy it to another Office 365 account. This limits its use for content that you want to persist should someone leave the company. Office 365 Admins can transfer ownership though. I plan on using it for interactive reports that customers see since I can display charts/metrics, etc from other Office 365 apps and the 'sway' will automatically update when the content is updated.",

It sometimes has issues with keeping up to date unless you are connected all the time to the internet.  So if you run it on a laptop and put it in your bag while others make changes, you need to refresh the page.  It also only allows one person to be assigned to a card, which is annoying for pairing.
